# CDKTF: Infrastructure as Code for Type Developers

# Importance of Infrastructure as Code

![Importance of Infrastructure as Code](images/importance-of-iac.png)

- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a practice of managing and provisioning infrastructure through code instead of manual processes
- Enables consistent, repeatable, and version-controlled infrastructure deployments
- Bridges the gap between development and operations teams
- Facilitates DevOps practices and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD)
- Allows for infrastructure to be treated with the same rigor as application code

# Benefits of Infrastructure as Code (1/2)

![Benefits of Infrastructure as Code](images/benefits-of-iac.png)

- **Version Control**: Track changes, rollback when needed
- **Consistency**: Eliminate configuration drift
- **Automation**: Reduce manual errors and speed up deployments
- **Documentation**: Self-documenting infrastructure

---

# Benefits of Infrastructure as Code (2/2)

![Benefits of Infrastructure as Code](images/benefits-of-iac.png)

- **Scalability**: Easily replicate environments
- **Testing**: Test infrastructure changes before applying
- **Collaboration**: Enable teams to work together on infrastructure
- **Cost Efficiency**: Optimize resource usage and reduce operational costs

---

# Problems Without Infrastructure as Code (1/2)

![Problems Without Infrastructure as Code](images/problems-without-iac.png)

- **Configuration Drift**: Manual changes lead to inconsistencies
- **Snowflake Servers**: Unique, unreproducible server configurations
- **Knowledge Silos**: Infrastructure knowledge limited to specific individuals
- **Slow Provisioning**: Manual processes delay new environment creation

# Problems Without Infrastructure as Code (2/2)

![Problems Without Infrastructure as Code](images/problems-without-iac.png)

- **Human Error**: Manual configuration prone to mistakes
- **Limited Auditability**: Difficult to track who changed what and when
- **Scaling Challenges**: Manual processes don't scale with growing infrastructure
- **Environment Inconsistency**: Dev, test, and production environments differ

# Terraform State (1/2)

![Terraform State](images/terraform-state.png)

- Terraform state is a snapshot of your infrastructure at a point in time
- Maps real-world resources to your configuration
- Tracks metadata such as resource dependencies
- Stores sensitive values from your infrastructure

---

# Terraform State (2/2)

![Terraform State](images/terraform-state.png)

- Can be stored locally or remotely (recommended for team environments)
- Remote state enables collaboration and locking to prevent concurrent modifications
- Critical for Terraform to function correctly - never manually edit state files!

```

1. Write infrastructure in a programming language
2. CDKTF synthesizes to Terraform JSON/HCL
3. Terraform processes the configuration
4. Resources are provisioned in the cloud

# Benefits of Using Programming Languages for Infrastructure (1/2)

![Benefits of Programming Languages](images/benefits-of-programming-languages.png)

- **Type Safety**: Catch errors at compile time rather than deployment time
- **Abstraction**: Create reusable components and higher-level constructs
- **IDE Support**: Code completion, refactoring, and inline documentation
- **Testing**: Unit test your infrastructure code

---

# Benefits of Using Programming Languages for Infrastructure (2/2)

![Benefits of Programming Languages](images/benefits-of-programming-languages.png)

- **Loops and Conditionals**: Native language constructs for complex logic
- **Modularity**: Better code organization with classes and modules
- **Ecosystem**: Leverage existing libraries and tools
- **Familiar Syntax**: Use languages developers already know
